This is the simplest and oldes form of encryption.\n<img src=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ons_Jallouli/publication/321123382/figure/download/fig1/AS:561500478808064@1510883554986/Symmetric-encryption-primitive.png\" alt=\"Symmetric Key Example\" style=\"zoom:67%;\" />\n##### Benefits\n*   Very secure when key is kept safe\n*   Useful when a large amount of data needs to be encrypted since it requires less computing power\n##### Drawbacks\n*   The key must be shared before a user can decrypt a message\n*   The integrity of the key is reduced as the key is shared with more people\n##### Common symmetric encryption\n*   Rivest Cipher\n*   Data Encryption Standard (DES)\n*   Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)\n*   Blowfish\n*   IDEA\n*   CAST\n*   Twofish\n##### Public/Private Keys\nUses two different keys to lock and unlock data that has been encrypted.\n*   User's public key encrypts data\n*   That user uses their private key to decrypt the data\n*   The private only decrypts data encrypted by its matching private key\n<img src=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ons_Jallouli/publication/321123382/figure/download/fig2/AS:561500483002368@1510883555030/Asymmetric-encryption-primitive.png\" alt=\"Asymmetric Keys\" style=\"zoom: 67%;\" />\nCombine the efficiency of symmetric encryption with the convenience of asymmetric encryption\n<h6><center>Hybrid Encryption</center></h6>\n![Hybrid Encryption](https://wizardforcel.gitbooks.io/practical-cryptography-for-developers-book/content/assets/hybrid-encryption.png)\n<h6><center>Hybrid Decryption</center></h6>\n![Hybrid Decryption](https://wizardforcel.gitbooks.io/practical-cryptography-for-developers-book/content/assets/hybrid-decryption.png)\nEvery message that is sent generates its own encryption key.

In order for a new node to join the blockchain must be copied to that node.\nThe process of adding blocks to the chain that requires miners (nodes) to compute extremely complex math problems. Mining nodes are paid for their work in a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin.\nAlthough all transactions are publicly visible, all personal information on the ledger is hidden from everyone through encryption.\nType of brute force attack where a hacker uses a list of words or phrases to try and guess the decryption key\nTries to find two inputs that produce the same hash value. Commonly used against digital signatures.\nThis attack combines both collision and brute-force attacks. Name comes from the birthday probability math problem.\nAn attack that forces the system to use an older, less secure communication protocol.\n"
