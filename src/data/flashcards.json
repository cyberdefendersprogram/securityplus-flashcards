The application control system can identify application packets instead of just applying a filter to the network traffic. By identifying the packets this solution can block unauthorized applications. A central application whitelist can be applied to all devices on the network.\n"}]},{"info":{"id":"iorNBj5scaAEjHF2Uf0mD","title":"Hardening Authentication","section":"6.6","date":"02-03-21"},"cards":[{"deckId":"iorNBj5scaAEjHF2Uf0mD","id":"MpxqlEVnphbKHBviMWiDQ","term":"Multifactor Authentication","definition":"Using more than one method to authenticate users.\n"},{"deckId":"iorNBj5scaAEjHF2Uf0mD","id":"UQm6_nN3KKFor0BMBHpf_","term":"Smart Cards","definition":"Using more than one method to authenticate users.\nSimilar in appearance to credit cards, smart cards have an embedded memory chip that contains encrypted authentication information.

Account lockout policies include:\n*   Account lockout duration\n    *   Specifies the number of minutes a locked-out account remains locked out before automatically becoming unlocked. When set to 0, an administrator must unlock the account.\n*   Account lockout threshold\n    *   Specifies the number of failed logon attempts that causes a user account to be locked out.\n*   Reset account lockout counter after\n    *   Specifies the number of minutes that must elapse after a failed logon attempt before the failed logon attempt counter is reset to 0 bad logon attempts. For example, if this value is set to 60 minutes and the account lockout threshold is set to 5, the user can enter up to four incorrect passwords within one hour without the account being locked.\nAccount lockout can be used to prevent attackers from guessing passwords, but it can also be used maliciously to lock an account and prevent a valid user from logging in\nWhen controlling user account and password security, be aware of the following:\n*   For large environments, implement a password management system with a self-service password reset management system.\n\n*   Implement account auditing to track incorrect login attempts.\n\n*   Scan systems to identify unused user accounts or accounts with blank passwords.\n\n*   Disable and/or remove default accounts.\n\n*   Prohibit the use of generic user accounts.\n\n*   Prohibit the use of shared user accounts.\n\n    Shared accounts:\n\n    *   Increase attack vectors.\n    *   Make password management more difficult.\n    *   Reduce responsibility for the account.\n    *   Destroy audit trails for the account.\n    *   Make it difficult to monitor the account for unusual activity.\nSmart cards are plastic cards similar to credit cards that have an embedded memory chip that contains encrypted authentication information.\n*   Can be divided into two categories:\n    *   Contact smart cards (Gold Plated Contact)\n    *   Contactless smart cards (RFID)\nKey benefits of smart cards include the following:\n*   They provide tamper-resistant storage for a user's private key and other personally identifying information (PII).\n*   They isolate security-related operations from the rest of the system.\n*   They allow security credentials to be portable.\nSmart cards are subject to the following weaknesses:\n*   Microprobing\n    *   This is the process of accessing the chip surface directly to observe, manipulate, and interfere with the circuit.\n*   Software attacks\n    *   These exploit vulnerabilities in the card's protocols or encryption methods.\n*   Eavesdropping\n    *   This captures transmission data produced by the card as it is used.\n*   Fault generation\n    *   This deliberately induces malfunctions in the card.\n"}]},{"info":{"id":"Ay1TybxF4XGLXICK929wW","title":"Cryptography","section":"7.1","date":"02-24-21"},"cards":[{"deckId":"Ay1TybxF4XGLXICK929wW","id":"_s2xdgAdjZlYG1tNRzVyD","term":"Cryptography","definition":"Cryptography is defined as the process of writing or solving messages using a secret code.
