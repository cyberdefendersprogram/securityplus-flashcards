The application control system can identify application packets instead of just applying a filter to the network traffic. By identifying the packets this solution can block unauthorized applications. A central application whitelist can be applied to all devices on the network.\n"

Allow remote access clients to connect to a DMZ and then monitor the traffic.\n*   Restrict remote access only to authorized clients.
