# Cryptography

Cryptography is defined as the process of writing or solving messages using a secret code. It is one additional layer of defense that can be used to protect data.

# Encryption

Taking normal text encrypting to create ciphertext.

# Cipher

Cipher is a method, or algorithm used to encrypt or convert data.

`ex. caesar shift cipher`

# Encryption Keys

Random strings of bits used to lock and unlock data

# Symmetric Keys

One key is used to lock and unlock data. This is the simplest and oldes form of encryption.

##### Benefits

- Very secure when key is kept safe
- Useful when a large amount of data needs to be encrypted since it requires less computing power

##### Drawbacks

- The key must be shared before a user can decrypt a message
- The integrity of the key is reduced as the key is shared with more people

##### Common symmetric encryption

- Rivest Cipher
- Data Encryption Standard (DES)
- Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
- Blowfish
- IDEA
- CAST
- Twofish

# Asymmetric Keys

##### Public/Private Keys

Uses two different keys to lock and unlock data that has been encrypted.

- User's public key encrypts data
- That user uses their private key to decrypt the data
- The private only decrypts data encrypted by its matching private key

# Hybrid Cryptosystems

Combine the efficiency of symmetric encryption with the convenience of asymmetric encryption

# Ephemeral Keys

Every message that is sent generates its own encryption key. In this way, an attacker cannot eavesdrop on an entire session.

# Hashing

The process of converting one value into another using an algorithm. Used on data that does not need to be decrypted.

##### Characteristics

- Deterministic, meaning the same input produces the same output
- Cannot be decrypted
- Hashing algorithms come in many form `MD5`, `SHA-0`, `SHA-1`, `SHA-3`

- Salt
  - Adding a random number of data to hash to make hashed data harder to find

# Elliptic Curve Cryptology (ECC)

Next generation of cryptography that produces smaller keys that are also more secure.

# Perfect Forward Secrecy

Most common in messaging apps where each transmission is encrypted with a different unique key.

# Stegonagraphy

Message/Data hiding within other files of various types.

# Stream Cipher

Encrypts data one bit at a time.

| Cipher Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Stream Cipher | Uses fixed length seed key such as 2048 bits<br />1. Creates a **keystream** by running key through a psuedorandom number generator<br />2. The **keystream** is XORed with the data to create the ciphertext<br />3. The seed key can be used repeatedly throughout the encryption process<br />Are less secure than one-time pad (OTP) but can be used in real-time. |

# Block Cipher

Encrypt data a chunk at a time.

| Operation Mode              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Electronic Code Book (ECB)  | ECB is the simplest mode of operation<br />- Each block of plaintext data is encrypted separately                                                                                                   |
| Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) | CBC is similar to ECB expect this mode uses an initialization vector (IV)                                                                                                                           |
| Cipher Feedback Mode (CFB)  | Uses an IV, but encrypts the IV first instead of using plain text. The output is XORed with the plaintext to create the block of ciphertext                                                         |
| Output Feedback Mode (OFB)  | This mode is identical to CFB but the IV is used after the first round                                                                                                                              |
| Counter Mode (CTR)          | Instead of using an initialization vector, CTR uses a nonce comined witha counter that is encrypted<br />- A **nonce** is a random string that is used for all blocks during the encryption process |
| Galois Counter Mode (GCM)   | GCM provides both encryption and authentication                                                                                                                                                     |

# Blockchain

A decentralized and distributed ledger that records and verifies transactions between two parties.

# Blockchain Blocks

Each block is a transaction that is stored publicly on the chain. The block contains information such as:

- Time
- Date
- Parties Involved
- A unique hash that separates the block from other blocks on the chain

# Blockchain Nodes

Each node of the blockchain plays a role in verifying and recording transactions. In order for a new node to join the blockchain must be copied to that node.

# Blockchain Mining

The process of adding blocks to the chain that requires miners (nodes) to compute extremely complex math problems. Mining nodes are paid for their work in a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin.

# Blockchain Privacy

Although all transactions are publicly visible, all personal information on the ledger is hidden from everyone through encryption.

# Dictionary Attack

Type of brute force attack where a hacker uses a list of words or phrases to try and guess the decryption key

# Collision Attack

Tries to find two inputs that produce the same hash value. Commonly used against digital signatures.

# Birthday Attack

This attack combines both collision and brute-force attacks. Name comes from the birthday probability math problem.

# Downgrade Attack

An attack that forces the system to use an older, less secure communication protocol.
